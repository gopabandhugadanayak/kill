/*
Create a class EvCar of the following attributes 

-- m_car_id which is a string type
-- m_battery_charging_time which is a int value(indicating full  charging battery starts from 0% to 100%)
-- m_platform which is either PURE_EV or IC_BASED
-- m_chasis_length which is a float value
-- M_seat_count which is a integer value
-- m_top_speed which is a integer value

Create a file functionalites.cpp and put the following functions

-- A function which create 5 instances in a container that stores data contiguiously ,Instances must be
   created at heap and should be managed by a smart pointer

--// A function to  return m_top_speed of the EvCar instances from the input container whoose m_car_id is passed as parameter

//a function to find and return std::list on first N instances from the input container where N is taken as a input parameter(consider invalid N value inputs appropiateley)

    //a function to find and  return count of instance whoose m_chasis_length is above 2.7f 

//A function to return a container of all instances from the input data which satisfy the predicate(passed as a function pointer or lambda)

    //A function to find and return a boolean to indicate wheather at least one input data instance has m_platform value as PURE_EV


*/


/*
Note;-

1_create a special member function as per requirement
2- create necessary parameeterzed constructor and getters and setters
3- overload <<operator for the class
4- handle all corner cases using std::nullopt and std::optional
5-use  STL algo to perform all operations
